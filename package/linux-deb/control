Description: Command-driven scriptable Modbus utility
 This is a utility that can be used on several
 operating systems, which can communicate with
 connected equipment using Modbus/ASCII, -/RTU
 and -/TCP protocols. The program can - even
 automatically - read, write or copy data from
 one device to another (e.g. transferring
 settings).
