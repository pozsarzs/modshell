Description: Command-driven scriptable Modbus utility
This is a utility that can be used on several
operating systems, which can communicate with
connected equipment using Modbus/ASCII, -/RTU
and -/TCP protocols. The program can - even
automatically - read, write or copy data from
one device to another (e.g. transferring
settings).
