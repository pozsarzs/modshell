#### 3. About

This is a utility that can be used on several operating systems, which can
communicate with connected equipment using [Modbus](https://modbus.org/)/ASCII,
Modbus/RTU and Modbus/TCP protocols. The program can - even automatically -
read, write or copy data from one device to another (e.g. transferring
settings). When copying, the source and destination register areas can be
different.

The program has a *traditional (CLI)* or *full-screen (TUI) command-line*
interface and is also *suitable for running pre-created scripts* independently
(as a command interpreter). The program provides help on the commands that can
be used, and offers possible values when the parameters are entered incorrectly.
The issued commands are placed in history, which can be browsed with the up/down
arrow keys.

**Operating principle**

It must be defined the I/O devices, then the protocols and the connections.
There can be eight of each. The data traffic takes place between the preset
connections. In all cases, the data is sent to or read from the internal buffer.
The size of the buffer is suitable for storing 2*9999 logical and word values of
the same size. One hundred and twenty-eight variables or constant can be created
in the program, to which we can assign a value of any type (eg.: string, boolean
or integer register value, real number, etc.) Variables can be used to perform
logical and arithmetical operations, and can be used to pass values to commands.

**Projects**

In the program, you can create projects for easier management of settings and
data. The name of the current project is shown in the prompt. The project
directory will be created in the program directory on DOS, and in the ModShell
directory in the user's home directory on all other systems. If only filename
is specified during file operations (without path), this directory will be the
source/destination directory.

**File operations**

The command line history can be exported to a text file and provides it with
the appropriate 'shebang' for the installation method and operating system. You
can easily create a script from this raw file.

The script on the disc can be loaded into the already running program and
started manually.

Device, protocol and connection settings can be saved and loaded in their own
format. During saving, three typed files are created, with the following
extensions: DDT, PDT, CDT.

All register values can be saved and loaded in their own format. During saving,
two typed files are created, with the following extensions: BDT, IDT.

One or more same type registers can be exported to file. During saving, one text
file is created, with CSV, INI or XML extension. The program can only import
from INI and XML format files.

We can also create time-stamped log entries with the program.

On exit, the command line history, echo mode and colors are preserved.

**Serial connection**

The program also provides the possibility to send and receive raw data via a
serial port, and also includes a very simple serial console. The display of sent
and received data can be turned off or raw text and hexadecimal viewing can be
selected.

**Documentation and Help**

Modshell has a minimal built-in help which you can access by typing help.
Additionally, you can view the manual page from *nix shell (_man modshell_) or
_modshell.txt_ on other systems.
