# Modshell

<br>

**Command-driven scriptable Modbus utility**

Copyright (C) 2023-2025 Pozs√°r Zsolt <pozsarzs@gmail.com>  

## About this project

This project started in December 2023 as a Christmas project, to wind down the
busy end-of-year period.The original goal was to create a utility that would
allow multiple Modbus devices of the same type to be configured without using
a touchpad.  

The project has grown considerably in size over time, but many features have
been implemented that make it more useful. With the growth, the goal has also
been reformulated: the program must have multiple user interfaces, be usable on
many operating systems, handle multiple communication channels and protocols, be
suitable for many tasks, and even work automatically.  

The next goal is to create a field (installed) or handheld (mobile) data
collector, converter, processor, etc., as well as a data and traffic monitoring
device that works reliably, using this program, a single-board computer, and a
mini HMI.  

The choice of source language fell on the outdated and neglected FreePascal.
Partly because of its multiplatform nature ('Write once - compile everywhere'),
partly because it is what I feel most comfortable with. I'm not sure it was the
best choice, but you have to make the most of it.  

The benefit of the project is not the finished product, as there are 'thousands'
of similar products on the market. The biggest benefit is the development of
logical thinking and the knowledge we gain while programming, but the greatest
is the joy of creation. And this is not dependent on the programming language.  

## I. Features

ModShell is a utility built around a command interpreter, which with the
connected peripherals communicates via various ports using the Modbus, DCON and
HART protocols.

## V. About the program in a nutshell

This is a utility that can be used on several operating systems, which can
communicate with connected equipment using Modbus/ASCII,
Modbus/RTU and Modbus/TCP protocols [^4]. The basic communication protocol
of the program is Modbus, but DCON  and HART was also implemented due to
communication with other devices. The range of foreign protocols may be expanded
later. The program can - even automatically - read, write or copy data from one
device to another (e.g. transferring settings). When copying, the source and
destination register areas can be different.

The ModShell program has a *traditional (CLI)* or *full-screen (TUI) command-line*
interface and is also *suitable for running pre-created scripts* independently
(as a command interpreter). The program provides help on the commands that can
be used, and offers possible values when the parameters are entered incorrectly.
The issued commands are placed in history, which can be browsed with the up/down
arrow keys.

The XModShell program has a *graphical interface (GUI)*, which helps to perform
several operations with dialog windows, but the original command line input
remained available for them (e.g. file selection, settings, etc.) [^5].

### Operating principle  

It must be defined the I/O devices, then the protocols and the connections.
There can be eight of each. The data traffic takes place between the preset
connections. In all cases, the data is sent to or read from the internal buffer.
The size of the buffer is suitable for storing 2*9999 logical and word values of
the same size.

128 variables and 32 arrays (which can also be constants) can be created in
the program, to which we can assign a value of any type (eg.: string, boolean
or integer register value, real number, etc.). Variables and constants can be
used to perform logical and arithmetical operations, and can be used to pass
values to commands.

It is possible to create 32 single-line macros to replace frequently used longer
commands. The program includes 3 pre-created macros, the content of which can
also be changed.

### Projects  

In the program, you can create projects for easier management of settings and
data. The name of the current project is shown in the prompt. The project
directory will be created in the program directory on DOS, and in the ModShell
directory in the user's home directory on all other systems. If only filename
is specified during file operations (without path), this directory will be the
source/destination directory.

### File operations  

The command line history can be exported to a text file and provides it with
the appropriate 'shebang' for the installation method and operating system. You
can easily create a script from this raw file.

Device, protocol and connection settings can be saved and loaded in their own
format. During saving, three typed files are created, with the following
extensions: DDT, PDT, CDT.

All register values can be saved and loaded in their own format. During saving,
two typed files are created, with the following extensions: BDT, IDT.

One or more same type registers can be exported to file. During saving, one text
file is created, with CSV, INI or XML extension. The program can only import
from INI and XML format files.

We can also create time-stamped log entries with the program and or script.

On exit, the command line history, input and echo mode and colors are preserved.

The program also has basic file and directory management commands.

### Script operations  

The script on the disc can be loaded into the already running program and
started manually.

The loaded script can be edited with a line editor, saved to disk or
deleted from the buffer. The graphical version has a simple editor window
with syntax highlighting instead of the line editor.

Variables, constants and macros defined before running the script will be
deleted. It is also possible to observe the values of up to four variables
during runtime and to keep the final values‚Äãof constants and variables created
during runtime.

In interpreter mode, operating system command line arguments are available as
predefined constants.

### Raw serial connection  

The program provides the possibility to send and receive raw data via a
serial port, and also includes a very simple serial console. The display of sent
and received data can be turned off or raw text and hexadecimal viewing can be
selected.

### Serial connection with DCON protocol  

The program also provides the possibility to send and receive data with DCON
protocol via a serial port.

### Serial connection with HART protocol  

The program also provides the possibility to send and receive data with HART
protocol via a serial port. A serial/HART gateway may be required for connection.

### Raw TCP connection  

The program provides the possibility to send and receive raw data via network
device with TCP, and also includes a very simple TCP console. The display of
sent and received data can be turned off or raw text and hexadecimal viewing
can be selected.

### Raw UDP connection  

The program provides the possibility to send and receive raw data via network
device with UDP, and also includes a very simple UDP console. The display of
sent and received data can be turned off or raw text and hexadecimal viewing
can be selected.

### Direct I/O access  

The program provides direct, byte-sized reading and writing of hardware I/O
ports. On Windows operating systems, it uses the included external dynamically
linked library.

## VIII. Documentation and Help  

Modshell and XModShell has a minimal built-in help which you can access by
typing help. Additionally, you can view the manual page from *nix shell
(_man modshell_) or _modshell.txt_ on other systems.  

In the graphical version, the Online Wiki can be opened directly from the 'Help'
menu.
