#### About

*ATTENTION! The program is still under development,
it is not yet suitable for its task.*

This is a utility that can be used on several operating systems,
which can communicate with connected equipment using
[Modbus](https://modbus.org/)/ASCII, -/RTU and -/TCP protocols.
The program can - even automatically - read, write or copy data from
one device to another (e.g. transferring settings). When copying, the
source and destination register areas can be different.

The program has a traditional (CLI) or full-screen (TUI) command-line
interface and is also suitable for running pre-created scripts
independently (as a command interpreter). The program provides help
on the commands that can be used, and offers possible values when
the parameters are entered incorrectly.
The issued commands are placed in history, which can be browsed with
the up/down arrow keys. The history can be exported to a text file and
provides it with the appropriate 'shebang' for the installation method
and operating system (eg. #!/usr/local/bin/modshell). You can easily
create a script from this raw file.

**Operating principle:**  

It must be defined the I/O devices, then the protocols and the
connections. There can be eight of each. These can be saved to
disk to binary format and reloaded. The data traffic takes place
between the preset connections.
In all cases, the data is sent to or read from the internal buffer.
The size of the buffer is suitable for storing 2*9999 logical and
word values of the same size. The contents of the buffer can be
exported to a text file.

(Commands with function keys (F?) are executed immediately,
 modifier keys (ALT-?) only make typing easier.)
