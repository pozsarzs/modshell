## Modshell

**Command-driven scriptable Modbus utility**

Copyright (C) 2023-2025 Pozs√°r Zsolt <pozsarzs@gmail.com>  

ModShell is a utility built around a command interpreter, which with the
connected peripherals communicates via various ports using the Modbus, DCON and
HART protocols. (The Modbus/TCP and HART support feature will be available from
v0.1-beta2 release.)

#### 3. About

This is a utility that can be used on several operating systems, which can
communicate with connected equipment using Modbus/ASCII,
Modbus/RTU and Modbus/TCP protocols [^4]. The basic communication protocol
of the program is Modbus, but DCON  and HART was also implemented due to
communication with other devices. The range of foreign protocols may be expanded
later. The program can - even automatically - read, write or copy data from one
device to another (e.g. transferring settings). When copying, the source and
destination register areas can be different.

The ModShell program has a *traditional (CLI)* or *full-screen (TUI) command-line*
interface and is also *suitable for running pre-created scripts* independently
(as a command interpreter). The program provides help on the commands that can
be used, and offers possible values when the parameters are entered incorrectly.
The issued commands are placed in history, which can be browsed with the up/down
arrow keys.

The XModShell program has a *graphical interface (GUI)*, which helps to perform
several operations with dialog windows, but the original command line input
remained available for them (e.g. file selection, settings, etc.) [^5].

**Operating principle**

It must be defined the I/O devices, then the protocols and the connections.
There can be eight of each. The data traffic takes place between the preset
connections. In all cases, the data is sent to or read from the internal buffer.
The size of the buffer is suitable for storing 2*9999 logical and word values of
the same size.

128 variables and 32 arrays (which can also be constants) can be created in
the program, to which we can assign a value of any type (eg.: string, boolean
or integer register value, real number, etc.). Variables and constants can be
used to perform logical and arithmetical operations, and can be used to pass
values to commands.

It is possible to create 32 single-line macros to replace frequently used longer
commands. The program includes 3 pre-created macros, the content of which can
also be changed.

**Projects**

In the program, you can create projects for easier management of settings and
data. The name of the current project is shown in the prompt. The project
directory will be created in the program directory on DOS, and in the ModShell
directory in the user's home directory on all other systems. If only filename
is specified during file operations (without path), this directory will be the
source/destination directory.

**File operations**

The command line history can be exported to a text file and provides it with
the appropriate 'shebang' for the installation method and operating system. You
can easily create a script from this raw file.

Device, protocol and connection settings can be saved and loaded in their own
format. During saving, three typed files are created, with the following
extensions: DDT, PDT, CDT.

All register values can be saved and loaded in their own format. During saving,
two typed files are created, with the following extensions: BDT, IDT.

One or more same type registers can be exported to file. During saving, one text
file is created, with CSV, INI or XML extension. The program can only import
from INI and XML format files.

We can also create time-stamped log entries with the program and or script.

On exit, the command line history, input and echo mode and colors are preserved.

The program also has basic file and directory management commands.

**Script operations**

The script on the disc can be loaded into the already running program and
started manually.

The loaded script can be edited with a line editor, saved to disk or
deleted from the buffer. The graphical version has a simple editor window
with syntax highlighting instead of the line editor.

Variables, constants and macros defined before running the script will be
deleted. It is also possible to observe the values of up to four variables
during runtime and to keep the final values‚Äãof constants and variables created
during runtime.

In interpreter mode, operating system command line arguments are available as
predefined constants.

**Raw serial connection**

The program provides the possibility to send and receive raw data via a
serial port, and also includes a very simple serial console. The display of sent
and received data can be turned off or raw text and hexadecimal viewing can be
selected.

**Serial connection with DCON protocol**

The program also provides the possibility to send and receive data with DCON
protocol via a serial port.

**Serial connection with HART protocol**

The program also provides the possibility to send and receive data with HART
protocol via a serial port. A serial/HART gateway may be required for connection.

**Raw TCP connection**

The program provides the possibility to send and receive raw data via network
device with TCP, and also includes a very simple TCP console. The display of
sent and received data can be turned off or raw text and hexadecimal viewing
can be selected.

**Raw UDP connection**

The program provides the possibility to send and receive raw data via network
device with UDP, and also includes a very simple UDP console. The display of
sent and received data can be turned off or raw text and hexadecimal viewing
can be selected.

**Direct I/O access**

The program provides direct, byte-sized reading and writing of hardware I/O
ports. On Windows operating systems, it uses the included external dynamically
linked library.

**Documentation and Help**

Modshell and XModShell has a minimal built-in help which you can access by
typing help. Additionally, you can view the manual page from *nix shell
(_man modshell_) or _modshell.txt_ on other systems.  

In the graphical version, the Online Wiki can be opened directly from the 'Help'
menu.  

**Contributing**

requests from anyone. You can use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs, ask
questions, or suggest new features.
