    This is a utility that can be used on several operating systems, which can
    communicate with connected equipment using Modbus/ASCII, Modbus/RTU and
    Modbus/TCP protocols. The basic communication protocol of the program is
    Modbus, but DCON and HART was also implemented due to communication with
    other devices. The range of foreign protocols may be expanded later. The
    program is designed for DOS, Windows and Unix-like operating systems.
