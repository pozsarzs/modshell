Dear Programmer.

The files in this package are all donated as freeware. This means, that
you can make any use of them, alter them an give them away.

I would appreciate if you let the original file header in each file and
only add a view lines by your own to them.

I mainly wrote these files to learn programming (I'm a professional
programmer today) and now want to help others learning this beautiful
prefession. I sincerely hope these files help someone doing so.


Feel free to contact me on any question:
